After about a month and a half of development, I am proud to  officially launch [onlineresume.dev](https://www.onlineresume.dev/), an online resume builder I developed.
 
I created it because I found existing solutions frustrating, either due to high monthly costs (up to €30!) or the hassle of editing outdated PDFs in Photoshop or with free, limited tools.

I built OnlineResume.dev with the technologies I know best: React JS, Tailwind, NodeJS/Express, Puppeteer (to generate the PDF), Docker (for easy deployment) as far as the main tools are concerned.

It’s hosted on a truly free VPS through [Oracle Cloud Free Tier plan](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/free/), offering 1 GB of RAM, 45 GB of storage, and 1 Oracle CPU (OCPU), equivalent to 2 virtual CPUs on other providers, according to [Oracle](https://blogs.oracle.com/cloud-infrastructure/post/vcpu-and-ocpu-pricing-information). Not bad for a free VPS! For comparison, a similar setup would cost at least $6 per month on Digital Ocean.

My goal is to create a no-nonsense, simple, and user-friendly web app to create resumes

It has a free plan that allows the user to download 5 PDF resumes. Two resume templates are available for now, with more on the way to give users even more design options.
